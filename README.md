# COP4331-Large-Project
**UCF - Fall 2020**

## **Project Pitch**
It would be cumbersome for users to continue to rely on exhaustive google searches and handwritten cookbooks, only to find that they have to make an extra trip to the grocery store to get what the recipe requires. To address these challenges, we are developing **Seppi**, a web application that is also supported on Android.

Cooking has become a popular hobby throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world becomes more remote under the enforcement of "stay at home" orders, more people have used the kitchen to pass time and bring comfort in their homes, using the ingredients that they have on hand. This comes with the challenge of finding unique recipes.

**Seppi** takes into account all of the vegetables, spices, and other cooking material in your pantry, and offers available suggestions for unique recipes that you are able to make.

**Seppi** is designed to be meal planner and a food-focused online social networking service. **Seppi** will achieve this by:

1. Maintaining a inventory of ingredients to access anytime and anywhere
2. Discovering unique recipes based on the ingredients you have available
3. Finding new recipes from a community of like minded cooks

While all of this information can be already accessed through Google Search, **Seppi** strives to aggregate recipe recommendations and a community in a place that is easy to access. 

During this uncertain time, cooking is one way to bring order to our lives. Whether you are a cooking enthusiast or only have enough time to throw together lunch, Seppi's goal is to provide access to new recipes and a connection to a community of other like-minded cooks.
